refactor: adopt modern angular features and fix ui bug

- Refactored the application to use Angular Signals for state management, improving performance and simplifying the codebase.
- Centralized state logic in the GitService, making it a lightweight, signal-based store.
- Standardized file naming to follow Angular conventions.
- Cleaned up the Electron main process by separating IPC handlers into a dedicated file.
- Fixed a UI bug where the file being moved would appear in both the staged and unstaged lists temporarily.
- Updated the templates to use the new Angular 20 control flow syntax.
